# Brainfk-image-format
an image format thing for brainfk (kinda)
# What It Does
basically nothing.
currently all it does if output some code to a .bfif (brainfk image format) file. 
I am creating an image viewer kind of for it? 
It can only do 720p or below due to sheer size. 
Its not very efficent it basically decompresses files ridiculously. 
# Does it work
no.
