# Brainfk-image-format
an image format thing for brainfk (kinda)
# What It Does
basically nothing.
#                          
currently all it does if output some code to a .bfif (brainfk image format) file. 
#  
It can only do 720p or below due to sheer size.
#  
Its not very efficent it basically decompresses files ridiculously. 
# Does it work
no.
# Usage
Create an empty .bfif file for output
# 
Specify the the output file path and the input file at the bottom of generator.py
#
run generator.py
# 
go into viewer.py and specify the generated .bfif file at the bottom then run viewer.py
#
The viewer currently doesn't work, but might soon
